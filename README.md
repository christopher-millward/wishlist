# Description
This project was created to fulfill the never-ending requests from my family for a wishlist (apparently I'm hard to shop for or something?). 

## Tech Stack
This is a static site built using vanilla HMTL, CSS, and JS. All logic and styling is embedded in the HTML. 

There is absolutely nothing fancy in this project. And I think that's the beauty of it? This is left public to show the people that I do, in fact, know when to keep things simple. Plus, look at how fast the page loads!
